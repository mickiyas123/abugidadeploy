# Introduction

It's a very known fact that it is very hard to rely on the current education system in our counrty. That's why we created Abugida a platfrom for learning

Abugida is a site where you can get courses for free or paid, a user can ask question on concept you want to understand, a user can create rooms to talk about specific concepts, a user can also ask answer for questions inside those rooms

currently the site works for asking questions and answering questions more features will be updated soon

# The context

This project is our Portfolio Project, concluding our Foundations Year at ALX Africa. We were able to choose who we wanted to work with and what we wanted to work on, as long as we present a working program at the end of the two weeks of development
